This is useful for API testing because it\n * can be used to test the integration set up without incurring charges for\n * using the backend and to enable collaborative development of an API. In\n * collaborative development, a team can isolate their development effort by\n * setting up simulations of API components owned by other teams by using the\n * MOCK integrations. It is also used to return CORS-related headers to ensure\n * that the API method permits CORS access. In fact, the API Gateway console\n * integrates the OPTIONS method to support CORS with a mock integration.\n * Gateway responses are other examples of mock integrations.\n */\nexport class MockIntegration extends Integration {\n  constructor(options?: IntegrationOptions) {\n    super({\n      type: IntegrationType.MOCK,\n      options,\n    });\n  }\n}\n"],
