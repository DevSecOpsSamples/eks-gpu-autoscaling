 *
 * - Create your logging destination. You can use an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group, an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, or an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. For information about configuring logging destinations and the permissions that are required for each, see [Logging web ACL traffic information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide* .
 * - Associate your logging destination to your web ACL using a `PutLoggingConfiguration` request.
 *
 * When you successfully enable logging using a `PutLoggingConfiguration` request, AWS WAF creates an additional role or policy that is required to write logs to the logging destination. For an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group, AWS WAF creates a resource policy on the log group. For an Amazon S3 bucket, AWS WAF creates a bucket policy.

         * *BASE64_DECODE_EXT* - Decode a `Base64` -encoded string, but use a forgiving implementation that ignores characters that aren't valid.
         *
         * *CMD_LINE* - Command-line transformations. These are helpful in reducing effectiveness of attackers who inject an operating system command-line command and use unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command.
         *
         * - Delete the following characters: `\ " ' ^`
         * - Delete spaces before the following characters: `/ (`
         * - Replace the following characters with a space: `, ;`
         * - Replace multiple spaces with one space
         * - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)
         *
         * *COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE* - Replace these characters with a space character (decimal 32):
         *
         * - `\f` , formfeed, decimal 12
         * - `\t` , tab, decimal 9
         * - `\n` , newline, decimal 10
         * - `\r` , carriage return, decimal 13
         * - `\v` , vertical tab, decimal 11
         * - Non-breaking space, decimal 160
         *
         * `COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.
         *
         * *CSS_DECODE* - Decode characters that were encoded using CSS 2.x escape rules `syndata.html#characters` . This function uses up to two bytes in the decoding process, so it can help to uncover ASCII characters that were encoded using CSS encoding that wouldn’t typically be encoded. It's also useful in countering evasion, which is a combination of a backslash and non-hexadecimal characters. For example, `ja\vascript` for javascript.
         *
         * *ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE* - Decode the following ANSI C escape sequences: `\a` , `\b` , `\f` , `\n` , `\r` , `\t` , `\v` , `\\` , `\?` , `\'` , `\"` , `\xHH` (hexadecimal), `\0OOO` (octal). Encodings that aren't valid remain in the output.
         *
         * *HEX_DECODE* - Decode a string of hexadecimal characters into a binary.
         *
         * *HTML_ENTITY_DECODE* - Replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. `HTML_ENTITY_DECODE` performs these operations:
         *
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)quot;` with `"`
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)nbsp;` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)lt;` with a "less than" symbol
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)gt;` with `>`
         * - Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, `(ampersand)#xhhhh;` , with the corresponding characters
         * - Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, `(ampersand)#nnnn;` , with the corresponding characters
         *
         * *JS_DECODE* - Decode JavaScript escape sequences. If a `\` `u` `HHHH` code is in the full-width ASCII code range of `FF01-FF5E` , then the higher byte is used to detect and adjust the lower byte. If not, only the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed, causing a possible loss of information.
         *
         * *LOWERCASE* - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).
         *
         * *MD5* - Calculate an MD5 hash from the data in the input. The computed hash is in a raw binary form.
         *
         * *NONE* - Specify `NONE` if you don't want any text transformations.
         *
         * *NORMALIZE_PATH* - Remove multiple slashes, directory self-references, and directory back-references that are not at the beginning of the input from an input string.
         *
         * *NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN* - This is the same as `NORMALIZE_PATH` , but first converts backslash characters to forward slashes.
         *
         * *REMOVE_NULLS* - Remove all `NULL` bytes from the input.
         *
         * *REPLACE_COMMENTS* - Replace each occurrence of a C-style comment ( `/* ... * /` ) with a single space. Multiple consecutive occurrences are not compressed. Unterminated comments are also replaced with a space (ASCII 0x20). However, a standalone termination of a comment ( `* /` ) is not acted upon.
         *
         * *REPLACE_NULLS* - Replace NULL bytes in the input with space characters (ASCII `0x20` ).
         *
         * *SQL_HEX_DECODE* - Decode SQL hex data. Example ( `0x414243` ) will be decoded to ( `ABC` ).
         *
         * *URL_DECODE* - Decode a URL-encoded value.
         *
         * *URL_DECODE_UNI* - Like `URL_DECODE` , but with support for Microsoft-specific `%u` encoding. If the code is in the full-width ASCII code range of `FF01-FF5E` , the higher byte is used to detect and adjust the lower byte. Otherwise, only the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed.
         *
         * *UTF8_TO_UNICODE* - Convert all UTF-8 character sequences to Unicode. This helps input normalization, and minimizing false-positives and false-negatives for non-English languages.

 * Use an `WebACL` to define a collection of rules to use to inspect and control web requests. Each rule has an action defined (allow, block, or count) for requests that match the statement of the rule. In the web ACL, you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the rules. The rules in a web ACL can contain rule statements that you define explicitly and rule statements that reference rule groups and managed rule groups. You can associate a web ACL with one or more AWS resources to protect. The resources can be an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer , or an AWS AppSync GraphQL API.

         * *BASE64_DECODE_EXT* - Decode a `Base64` -encoded string, but use a forgiving implementation that ignores characters that aren't valid.
         *
         * *CMD_LINE* - Command-line transformations. These are helpful in reducing effectiveness of attackers who inject an operating system command-line command and use unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command.
         *
         * - Delete the following characters: `\ " ' ^`
         * - Delete spaces before the following characters: `/ (`
         * - Replace the following characters with a space: `, ;`
         * - Replace multiple spaces with one space
         * - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)
         *
         * *COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE* - Replace these characters with a space character (decimal 32):
         *
         * - `\f` , formfeed, decimal 12
         * - `\t` , tab, decimal 9
         * - `\n` , newline, decimal 10
         * - `\r` , carriage return, decimal 13
         * - `\v` , vertical tab, decimal 11
         * - Non-breaking space, decimal 160
         *
         * `COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.
         *
         * *CSS_DECODE* - Decode characters that were encoded using CSS 2.x escape rules `syndata.html#characters` . This function uses up to two bytes in the decoding process, so it can help to uncover ASCII characters that were encoded using CSS encoding that wouldn’t typically be encoded. It's also useful in countering evasion, which is a combination of a backslash and non-hexadecimal characters. For example, `ja\vascript` for javascript.
         *
         * *ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE* - Decode the following ANSI C escape sequences: `\a` , `\b` , `\f` , `\n` , `\r` , `\t` , `\v` , `\\` , `\?` , `\'` , `\"` , `\xHH` (hexadecimal), `\0OOO` (octal). Encodings that aren't valid remain in the output.
         *
         * *HEX_DECODE* - Decode a string of hexadecimal characters into a binary.
         *
         * *HTML_ENTITY_DECODE* - Replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. `HTML_ENTITY_DECODE` performs these operations:
         *
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)quot;` with `"`
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)nbsp;` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)lt;` with a "less than" symbol
         * - Replaces `(ampersand)gt;` with `>`
         * - Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, `(ampersand)#xhhhh;` , with the corresponding characters
         * - Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, `(ampersand)#nnnn;` , with the corresponding characters
         *
         * *JS_DECODE* - Decode JavaScript escape sequences. If a `\` `u` `HHHH` code is in the full-width ASCII code range of `FF01-FF5E` , then the higher byte is used to detect and adjust the lower byte. If not, only the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed, causing a possible loss of information.
         *
         * *LOWERCASE* - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).
         *
         * *MD5* - Calculate an MD5 hash from the data in the input. The computed hash is in a raw binary form.
         *
         * *NONE* - Specify `NONE` if you don't want any text transformations.
         *
         * *NORMALIZE_PATH* - Remove multiple slashes, directory self-references, and directory back-references that are not at the beginning of the input from an input string.
         *
         * *NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN* - This is the same as `NORMALIZE_PATH` , but first converts backslash characters to forward slashes.
         *
         * *REMOVE_NULLS* - Remove all `NULL` bytes from the input.
         *
         * *REPLACE_COMMENTS* - Replace each occurrence of a C-style comment ( `/* ... * /` ) with a single space. Multiple consecutive occurrences are not compressed. Unterminated comments are also replaced with a space (ASCII 0x20). However, a standalone termination of a comment ( `* /` ) is not acted upon.
         *
         * *REPLACE_NULLS* - Replace NULL bytes in the input with space characters (ASCII `0x20` ).
         *
         * *SQL_HEX_DECODE* - Decode SQL hex data. Example ( `0x414243` ) will be decoded to ( `ABC` ).
         *
         * *URL_DECODE* - Decode a URL-encoded value.
         *
         * *URL_DECODE_UNI* - Like `URL_DECODE` , but with support for Microsoft-specific `%u` encoding. If the code is in the full-width ASCII code range of `FF01-FF5E` , the higher byte is used to detect and adjust the lower byte. Otherwise, only the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed.
         *
         * *UTF8_TO_UNICODE* - Convert all UTF-8 character sequences to Unicode. This helps input normalization, and minimizing false-positives and false-negatives for non-English languages.
