 *
 * > You can't create a health check with simple routing.
 *
 * *ELB Load Balancers*
 *
 * If you're registering EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances. When you register an EC2 instance with a load balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, which performs a similar function to a Route 53 health check.
 *
 * *Private Hosted Zones*
 *
 * You can associate health checks with failover records in a private hosted zone. Note the following:
 *
 * - Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP address to the instance in the VPC.
 * - You can configure a health checker to check the health of an external resource that the instance relies on, such as a database server.
 * - You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the Amazon EC2 `StatusCheckFailed` metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the CloudWatch console, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) .

     *
     * - **Log Group and Resource Policy** - Before you create a query logging configuration, perform the following operations.
     *
     * > If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 console, Route 53 performs these operations automatically.
     *
     * - Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which you specify when you create a query logging configuration. Note the following:
     *
     * - You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.
     * - You must use the same AWS account to create the log group and the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging for.
     * - When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent prefix, for example:
     *
     * `/aws/route53/ *hosted zone name*`
     *
     * In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log groups and the associated AWS resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query logging.
     * - Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send query logs to log streams. For the value of `Resource` , specify the ARN for the log group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with `*` , for example:
     *
     * `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*`
     *
     * To avoid the confused deputy problem, a security issue where an entity without a permission for an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform it, you can optionally limit the permissions that a service has to a resource in a resource-based policy by supplying the following values:
     *
     * - For `aws:SourceArn` , supply the hosted zone ARN used in creating the query logging configuration. For example, `aws:SourceArn: arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/hosted zone ID` .
     * - For `aws:SourceAccount` , supply the account ID for the account that creates the query logging configuration. For example, `aws:SourceAccount:111111111111` .
     *
     * For more information, see [The confused deputy problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html) in the *AWS IAM User Guide* .

     * - **Log Streams and Edge Locations** - When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query logging, it does the following:
     *
     * - Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Route 53 responds to for that edge location.
     * - Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.
     *
     * The name of each log stream is in the following format:
     *
     * `*hosted zone ID* / *edge location code*`
     *
     * The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see "The Route 53 Global Network" on the [Route 53 Product Details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/details/) page.
     * - **Queries That Are Logged** - Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route 53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as the IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue to return the cached response. It doesn't forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource record set, and depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain information about only one query out of every several thousand queries that are submitted to DNS. For more information about how DNS works, see [Routing Internet Traffic to Your Website or Web Application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/welcome-dns-service.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .
     * - **Log File Format** - For a list of the values in each query log and the format of each value, see [Logging DNS Queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/query-logs.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .
     * - **Pricing** - For information about charges for query logs, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) .
     * - **How to Stop Logging** - If you want Route 53 to stop sending query logs to CloudWatch Logs, delete the query logging configuration. For more information, see [DeleteQueryLoggingConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteQueryLoggingConfig.html) .

/**
 * A CloudFormation `AWS::Route53::HostedZone`
 *
 * Creates a new public or private hosted zone. You create records in a public hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic on the internet for a domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (apex.example.com, acme.example.com). You create records in a private hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs).
 *
 * > You can't convert a public hosted zone to a private hosted zone or vice versa. Instead, you must create a new hosted zone with the same name and create new resource record sets.
 *
 * For more information about charges for hosted zones, see [Amazon Route 53 Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/) .
 *
 * Note the following:
 *
 * - You can't create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD) such as .com.
 * - For public hosted zones, Route 53 automatically creates a default SOA record and four NS records for the zone. For more information about SOA and NS records, see [NS and SOA Records that Route 53 Creates for a Hosted Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/SOA-NSrecords.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .
 *
 * If you want to use the same name servers for multiple public hosted zones, you can optionally associate a reusable delegation set with the hosted zone. See the `DelegationSetId` element.
 * - If your domain is registered with a registrar other than Route 53, you must update the name servers with your registrar to make Route 53 the DNS service for the domain. For more information, see [Migrating DNS Service for an Existing Domain to Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .
 *
 * When you submit a `CreateHostedZone` request, the initial status of the hosted zone is `PENDING` . For public hosted zones, this means that the NS and SOA records are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS servers. When the NS and SOA records are available, the status of the zone changes to `INSYNC` .
 *
 * The `CreateHostedZone` request requires the caller to have an `ec2:DescribeVpcs` permission.
 *
 * > When creating private hosted zones, the Amazon VPC must belong to the same partition where the hosted zone is created. A partition is a group of AWS Regions . Each AWS account is scoped to one partition.
 * >
 * > The following are the supported partitions:
 * >
 * > - `aws` - AWS Regions
 * > - `aws-cn` - China Regions
 * > - `aws-us-gov` - AWS GovCloud (US) Region
 * >
 * > For more information, see [Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the *AWS General Reference* .

     * Creates a configuration for DNS query logging. After you create a query logging configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to publish log data to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.

     * DNS query logs contain information about the queries that Route 53 receives for a specified public hosted zone, such as the following:
     *
     * - Route 53 edge location that responded to the DNS query
     * - Domain or subdomain that was requested
     * - DNS record type, such as A or AAAA
     * - DNS response code, such as `NoError` or `ServFail`
     *
     * - **Log Group and Resource Policy** - Before you create a query logging configuration, perform the following operations.
     *
     * > If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 console, Route 53 performs these operations automatically.
     *
     * - Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which you specify when you create a query logging configuration. Note the following:
     *
     * - You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.
     * - You must use the same AWS account to create the log group and the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging for.
     * - When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent prefix, for example:
     *
     * `/aws/route53/ *hosted zone name*`
     *
     * In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log groups and the associated AWS resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query logging.
     * - Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send query logs to log streams. For the value of `Resource` , specify the ARN for the log group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with `*` , for example:
     *
     * `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*`
     *
     * To avoid the confused deputy problem, a security issue where an entity without a permission for an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform it, you can optionally limit the permissions that a service has to a resource in a resource-based policy by supplying the following values:
     *
     * - For `aws:SourceArn` , supply the hosted zone ARN used in creating the query logging configuration. For example, `aws:SourceArn: arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/hosted zone ID` .
     * - For `aws:SourceAccount` , supply the account ID for the account that creates the query logging configuration. For example, `aws:SourceAccount:111111111111` .
     *
     * For more information, see [The confused deputy problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html) in the *AWS IAM User Guide* .

     *
     * > Although creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in a private hosted zone is allowed, it's not supported.
     *
     * If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.

Two groups of queries are routed to the resource that you specify in this record: queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a `*` resource record set, Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from those locations.

     * Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:
     *
     * - By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check
     * - By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)
     * - By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)

     *
     * *When to Specify HealthCheckId*
     *
     * Specifying a value for `HealthCheckId` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:
     *
     * - *Non-alias resource record sets* : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets.
     *
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     *
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.
     *
     * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
     * - *Alias resource record sets* : You specify the following settings:
     *
     * - You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).
     * - You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.
     * - You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.
     *
     * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     *
     * If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.
     *
     * > The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.
     *
     * *Geolocation Routing*
     *
     * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has `*` for `CountryCode` is `*` , which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:
     *
     * - The United States
     * - North America
     * - The default resource record set
     *
     * *Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name*
     *
     * If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each `HTTP` server that is serving content for `www.example.com` . For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the server (such as `us-east-2-www.example.com` ), not the name of the resource record sets ( `www.example.com` ).
     *
     * > Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
     * >
     * > - Create a health check that has the same value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` as the name of a resource record set.
     * > - Associate that health check with the resource record set.

     *
     * > Although creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in a private hosted zone is allowed, it's not supported.
     *
     * If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.

Two groups of queries are routed to the resource that you specify in this record: queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location.

     *
     * - By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check
     * - By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)

     *
     * *When to Specify HealthCheckId*
     *
     * Specifying a value for `HealthCheckId` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:
     *
     * - *Non-alias resource record sets* : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets.
     *
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     *
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.
     *
     * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
     * - *Alias resource record sets* : You specify the following settings:
     *
     * - You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).
     * - You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.
     * - You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.
     *
     * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     *
     * If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.
     *
     * > The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.
     *
     * *Geolocation Routing*
     *
     * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has `*` for `CountryCode` is `*` , which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:
     *
     * - The United States
     * - North America
     * - The default resource record set
     *
     * *Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name*
     *
     * If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each `HTTP` server that is serving content for `www.example.com` . For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the server (such as `us-east-2-www.example.com` ), not the name of the resource record sets ( `www.example.com` ).
     *
     * > Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
     * >
     * > - Create a health check that has the same value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` as the name of a resource record set.
     * > - Associate that health check with the resource record set.

     * - If you're associating this resource record set with a health check (if you're adding a `HealthCheckId` element), we recommend that you specify a `TTL` of 60 seconds or less so clients respond quickly to changes in health status.
     * - All of the resource record sets in a group of weighted resource record sets must have the same value for `TTL` .
     * - If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or more weighted alias resource record sets for which the alias target is an ELB load balancer, we recommend that you specify a `TTL` of 60 seconds for all of the non-alias weighted resource record sets that have the same name and type. Values other than 60 seconds (the TTL for load balancers) will change the effect of the values that you specify for `Weight` .

     * *Weighted resource record sets only:* Among resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries that Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set. Route 53 calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type. Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight to the total. Note the following:
     *
     * - You must specify a value for the `Weight` element for every weighted resource record set.
     * - You can only specify one `ResourceRecord` per weighted resource record set.
     * - You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements as weighted resource record sets.
     * - You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements.
     * - For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set `Weight` to `0` for a resource record set, Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for that resource record set. However, if you set `Weight` to `0` for all resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability.
     *
     * The effect of setting `Weight` to `0` is different when you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets.

         *
         * - For regional APIs, specify the value of `regionalDomainName` .

         *
         * > The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for your API, such as `api.example.com` .
         * - **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint** - Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as `vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com` . For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding CloudFront distribution. You can get the value of `DnsName` using the AWS CLI command [describe-vpc-endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html) .
         * - **CloudFront distribution** - Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.
         *
         * Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of the record. For example, if the name of the record is *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one of the alternate domain names. For more information, see [Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
         *
         * You can't create a record in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a CloudFront distribution.
         *
         * > For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.
         * - **Elastic Beanstalk environment** - If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the environment. For example, the domain name `my-environment. *us-west-2* .elasticbeanstalk.com` is a regionalized domain name.
         *
         * > For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
         *
         * For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the `CNAME` attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME attribute:
         *
         * - *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the console, see [Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html) in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .
         * - *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the `DescribeEnvironments` action to get the value of the `CNAME` attribute. For more information, see [DescribeEnvironments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html) in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference* .
         * - *AWS CLI* : Use the `describe-environments` command to get the value of the `CNAME` attribute. For more information, see [describe-environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html) in the *AWS CLI* .
         * - **ELB load balancer** - Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by using the AWS Management Console , the ELB API, or the AWS CLI .
         *
         * - *AWS Management Console* : Go to the EC2 page, choose *Load Balancers* in the navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the *Description* tab, and get the value of the *DNS name* field.
         *
         * If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins with *dualstack* . If you're routing traffic to another type of load balancer, get the value that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.
         * - *Elastic Load Balancing API* : Use `DescribeLoadBalancers` to get the value of `DNSName` . For more information, see the applicable guide:

         *
         * Note the following:
         *
         * - **CloudFront distributions** - You can't set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the alias target is a CloudFront distribution.
         * - **Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains** - If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in `DNSName` and the environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any.
         *
         * If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.
         * - **ELB load balancers** - Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:
         *
         * - *Classic Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in `DNSName` , Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other resources.
         * - *Application and Network Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Application or Network Load Balancer and you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` , Route 53 routes queries to the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load balancer:
         *
         * - For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries to other resources.
         * - A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.
         *
         * > When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer.
         * - **S3 buckets** - There are no special requirements for setting `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the alias target is an S3 bucket.
         * - **Other records in the same hosted zone** - If the AWS resource that you specify in `DNSName` is a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more information, see [What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

         *
         * - For regional APIs, specify the value of `regionalDomainName` .
         * - For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of `distributionDomainName` . This is the name of the associated CloudFront distribution, such as `da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net` .
         *
         * > The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for your API, such as `api.example.com` .
         * - **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint** - Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as `vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com` . For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding CloudFront distribution. You can get the value of `DnsName` using the AWS CLI command [describe-vpc-endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html) .
         * - **CloudFront distribution** - Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.
         *
         * Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of the record. For example, if the name of the record is *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one of the alternate domain names. For more information, see [Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
         *
         * You can't create a record in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a CloudFront distribution.
         *
         * > For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.
         * - **Elastic Beanstalk environment** - If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the environment. For example, the domain name `my-environment. *us-west-2* .elasticbeanstalk.com` is a regionalized domain name.
         *
         * > For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
         *
         * For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the `CNAME` attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME attribute:
         *
         * - *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the console, see [Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html) in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .
         * - *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the `DescribeEnvironments` action to get the value of the `CNAME` attribute. For more information, see [DescribeEnvironments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html) in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference* .
         * - *AWS CLI* : Use the `describe-environments` command to get the value of the `CNAME` attribute. For more information, see [describe-environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html) in the *AWS CLI* .
         * - **ELB load balancer** - Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by using the AWS Management Console , the ELB API, or the AWS CLI .
         *
         * - *AWS Management Console* : Go to the EC2 page, choose *Load Balancers* in the navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the *Description* tab, and get the value of the *DNS name* field.
         *
         * If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins with *dualstack* . If you're routing traffic to another type of load balancer, get the value that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.
         * - *Elastic Load Balancing API* : Use `DescribeLoadBalancers` to get the value of `DNSName` . For more information, see the applicable guide:
         *
         * - Classic Load Balancers: [DescribeLoadBalancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html)

         * *Applies only to alias records with any routing policy:* When `EvaluateTargetHealth` is `true` , an alias record inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB load balancer or another record in the hosted zone.
         *
         * Note the following:
         *
         * - **CloudFront distributions** - You can't set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the alias target is a CloudFront distribution.
         * - **Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains** - If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in `DNSName` and the environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any.
         *
         * If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.
         * - **ELB load balancers** - Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:
         *
         * - *Classic Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in `DNSName` , Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other resources.
         * - *Application and Network Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Application or Network Load Balancer and you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` , Route 53 routes queries to the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load balancer:
         *
         * - For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries to other resources.
         * - A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.
         *
         * > When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer.
         * - **S3 buckets** - There are no special requirements for setting `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the alias target is an S3 bucket.
         * - **Other records in the same hosted zone** - If the AWS resource that you specify in `DNSName` is a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more information, see [What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

         * If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.

         *
         * *When to Specify HealthCheckId*
         *
         * Specifying a value for `HealthCheckId` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:
         *
         * - *Non-alias resource record sets* : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets.
         *
         * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
         *
         * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.
         *
         * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
         * - *Alias resource record sets* : You specify the following settings:
         *
         * - You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).
         * - You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.
         * - You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.
         *
         * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
         *
         * If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.
         *
         * > The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.
         *
         * *Geolocation Routing*
         *
         * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has `*` for `CountryCode` is `*` , which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:
         *
         * - The United States
         * - North America
         * - The default resource record set
         *
         * *Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name*
         *
         * If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each `HTTP` server that is serving content for `www.example.com` . For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the server (such as `us-east-2-www.example.com` ), not the name of the resource record sets ( `www.example.com` ).
         *
         * > Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
         * >
         * > - Create a health check that has the same value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` as the name of a resource record set.
         * > - Associate that health check with the resource record set.

         * *Weighted resource record sets only:* Among resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries that Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set. Route 53 calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type. Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight to the total. Note the following:
         *
         * - You must specify a value for the `Weight` element for every weighted resource record set.
         * - You can only specify one `ResourceRecord` per weighted resource record set.
         * - You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements as weighted resource record sets.
         * - You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements.
         * - For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set `Weight` to `0` for a resource record set, Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for that resource record set. However, if you set `Weight` to `0` for all resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability.
         *
         * The effect of setting `Weight` to `0` is different when you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets.
